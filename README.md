# Dungeon Raider
Experimental simple console rogue adventure.

This game was entirely made during my idle time on tedious working days.

The main objective is to make it enjoyable as possible using only windows console interface. If you still reading this, prepare yourself for some 80's like graphics with non traditional sound effects.
